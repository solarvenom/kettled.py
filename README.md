## Installation
`kettled` can be installed directly from the PyPI repositories with:

```bash
pip install kettled
```

## Example: *How to use kettled*

The following example shows how `Kettled` is instantiated and how basic `events` are scheduled.

```py
import datetime as dt

from kettled import Kettled

def foo():
    print("foo")

kettled = Kettled()
kettled.init()

event_datetime = dt.datetime.now() + dt.timedelta(hours=2)

kettled.add(event_name="readme_event", date_time=event_datetime, callback=foo)

kettled.update(event_name="readme_event", new_date_time=event_datetime + dt.timedelta(minutes=30))

kettled.delete(event_name="readme_event")
```

# CLI interface usage
To launch `kettled` from the terminal simply issue `kettled start`:
```text
user@pc$ kettled start 
ğŸ«– kettled started.
```

Check daemon status via `kettled status`:
```text
user@pc$ kettled status
ğŸ«– kettled has been up for 27 minutes and 56 seconds.
```

You can add events from the terminal by issueing `kettled add` and inputing the event data via prompts:
```text
user@pc$ kettled add
ğŸ«– Please enter event name: readme_event
ğŸ«– Please enter event scheduled date: 2024-11-05 10:17:57.587410
ğŸ«– Please enter event callback: print('this is a callback function')
```

To update a scheduled event issue `kettled update` and go through the prompts to modify event data:
```text
user@pc$ kettled update
ğŸ«– Please enter the name of event be modified: readme_event

ğŸ«– Please enter the new event callback or leave blank to leave unchanged: 
```

To check all scheduled events just issue `kettled list`:
```text
user@pc$ kettled list
user@pc$ 
_______________________________________________________
