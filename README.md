Kettled is a fast, efficient and secure daemon-based event scheduler for UNIX-systems that spawns an independent process which keeps track of your scheduled events with a nice CLI UI.

## Features

- âœ¨ Built with python built-in modules only. No third-party modules involved.
- âœ¨ An easy-to-use CLI UI to manage and monitor your scheduler daemon.

## Installation

`kettled` can be installed directly from the PyPI repositories with:

```bash
pip install kettled
```

## Example: *How to use kettled*

The following example shows how `Kettled` is instantiated and how basic `events` are scheduled.

```py
import datetime as dt

from kettled import Kettled

def foo():
    print("foo")

kettled = Kettled()
kettled.init()

kettled.add(event_name="readme_event", date_time=dt.timedelta(minutes=10), callback=foo)

kettled.update(event_name="readme_event", new_date_time=dt.timedelta(minutes=30))

kettled.delete(event_name="readme_event")
```
